<br>
<br>

<big>My mom joined a trip travel for woman on January, 2019. My older sister and I also joined it because we never been to oversea.</big>
<br>
<big>It's was an exciting moments. We have to make our passport at Immigration Department of Malaysia.</big>
<br>
<big>We took a train from our town, Kampar, Perak, to Kuala Lumpur. We have to took a bus to go to Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA).</big>
<br>
<big>Our first experience ride a flight was the best. Eventhough when the plane want to departure, it was kind of scary, but eventually we make it.</big>
<br>
<big>When we arrive at Ho Chi Minh City Airport, we were so excited. Traffic were congestion as the population of this city were compact.</big>
<br>
<big>This is some of the picture I caught when I at Vietnam.(p.s: Please scroll till down)</big>
